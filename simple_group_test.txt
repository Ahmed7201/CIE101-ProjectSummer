To test the group functionality:

1. Build and run the application
2. Draw multiple shapes (rectangles, circles, squares, etc.)
3. Select shapes by clicking on them one by one (they should be highlighted)
4. You can select 2 to 10 shapes
5. Click on the group icon in the toolbar
6. All selected shapes should be grouped together
7. You can now move, rotate, or scale the entire group as one unit

To test the ungroup functionality:

1. Select a group (click on any shape in the group)
2. Click on the ungroup icon in the toolbar
3. The group should be broken back into individual shapes
4. You can now select and manipulate individual shapes again

Features of this version:
