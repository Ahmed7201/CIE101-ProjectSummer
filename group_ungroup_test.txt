GROUP AND UNGROUP FUNCTIONALITY TEST

The group and ungroup functionality is now fully implemented with the following features:

GROUP FUNCTIONALITY:
- Select 2 or more shapes (up to 10 maximum)
- Click the Group button/tool
- The selected shapes will be grouped together
- The group will be automatically selected after grouping

UNGROUP FUNCTIONALITY:
- Select a group (a previously grouped set of shapes)
- Click the Ungroup button/tool
- The group will be broken apart into individual shapes
- All individual shapes will be added back to the drawing area

FEATURES:
- Minimum 2 shapes required for grouping
- Maximum 10 shapes per group
- Groups can be selected, moved, rotated, and scaled as a single unit
- Groups maintain the individual properties of their component shapes
- No save/load functionality for groups (as requested)

TESTING STEPS:
1. Draw multiple shapes (circles, squares, triangles, etc.)
2. Select multiple shapes by clicking on them
3. Click the Group button to group them
4. Verify the shapes are now grouped (they move together)
5. Select the group and click Ungroup
6. Verify the shapes are now individual again

The implementation is clean and focused only on group/ungroup functionality without any unnecessary features.
